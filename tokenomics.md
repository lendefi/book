# LDFI Tokenomics

## What is the LDFI Token?

LDFI is the native token for the Lendefi Protocol \(“**Protocol**”\). LDFI is a governance token that controls the interest rate model, inclusion of supported assets, reward distribution, changes in the Protocol and other terms and conditions.

## Decentralized Governance <a id="50c0"></a>

Lendefi governance, via a Decentralized Autonomous Organization \(“**DAO**”\), allows active participation of the token holders in the governance of the Protocol.

## Voting <a id="fda8"></a>

Any address holding over 1% of the total LDFI tokens can create proposals for Protocol changes. Those changes can then be decided upon via voting on the DAO.

## Fees <a id="5091"></a>

The difference between the interest rate the borrower pays and the rate the lender receives, otherwise known as the "**spread**", will be used to purchase LDFI tokens from the market for the purpose of burning and rewards.

## Token Burning <a id="98bc"></a>

Through a process known as burning, LDFI tokens will be burnt, lowering the total and circulating supply. This will increase the value of LDFI tokens, creating further value for token holders.

## Rewards <a id="4457"></a>

A variety of rewards will be given to encourage the growth of the Protocol and the creation of value for token holders. Reward options will include **Staking**, **Liquidity**, **Liquidation** and **Yield Farming** rewards.
