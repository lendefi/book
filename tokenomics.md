# LDFI Tokenomics

## What is the LDFI Token?

LDFI is the native token for the Lendefi Protocol \(“**Protocol**”\). LDFI is a governance token that controls the interest rate model, inclusion of supported assets, reward distribution, changes in the Protocol and other terms and conditions.

## Decentralized Governance <a id="50c0"></a>

Lendefi governance, via a Decentralized Autonomous Organization \(“**DAO**”\), allows active participation of the token holders in the governance of the Protocol.

## Transaction Fee's

**1% Tax Fee** — Given back to all token holders  
**1% Buy Back Fee —** Used to Buy Back and Burn tokens  
**1% Wallet Fee** — Protocol & marketing funds

**Tx Fee % to Holders \(1%\)**  
The transaction fee % distributed to holders. This fee will be collected from all transactions as a percentage of the transaction token amount and reflected to current holders immediately. The fee is paid in the LDFI.

**Tx Fee % to Buyback Tokens \(1%\)**  
Hyper-deflationary mechanism.

The fee will be collected from all transactions as a percentage of the transaction token amount. Once the token contract holding exceeds 0.1% of the total supply, automated swap will be executed on a sell transaction and BNB will be added to the token contract. Once the BNB balance of the token contract exceeds 1 BNB, on a sell transaction 1% of the available BNB balance will be used to buy back and burn LDFI tokens.

**Tx Fee % to Wallet \(1%\)**  
The transaction fee % sent to the Lendefi Protocol’s multi-sig wallet.  
These funds will be used to fund Protocol and Marketing expenses.

**Excluded Addresses from Tx Fee**  
The following addresses have been excluded from the Tx Fee’s

## Voting <a id="fda8"></a>

Any address holding over 1% of the total LDFI tokens can create proposals for Protocol changes. Those changes can then be decided upon via voting on the DAO.

## Fees <a id="5091"></a>

The difference between the interest rate the borrower pays and the rate the lender receives, otherwise known as the "**spread**", will be used to purchase LDFI tokens from the market for the purpose of burning and rewards.

## Token Burning <a id="98bc"></a>

Through a process known as burning, LDFI tokens will be burnt, lowering the total and circulating supply. This will increase the value of LDFI tokens, creating further value for token holders.

## Rewards <a id="4457"></a>

A variety of rewards will be given to encourage the growth of the Protocol and the creation of value for token holders. Reward options will include **Staking**, **Liquidity**, **Liquidation** and **Yield Farming** rewards.
