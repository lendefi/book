# Introducing Lendefi Finance

The Lendefi Protocol \(“Protocol”\) facilitates secured lending, delivering confidence to lenders within the highly volatile cryptocurrency marketplace.

Lendefi's Protocol cuts the middleman out of the lending equation and eliminates the red tape involved with lending and borrowing. This removes counterparty risk between the borrower and the lender, creating a trustless transaction.

The lender receives a variable interest rate and through protocols such as Pancakeswap, is secured by the liquidity provided within the DeFi ecosystem. Hence, if the borrower is not able to maintain their loan, the Protocol will ensure the lender is repaid and the borrower credited with the remaining equity.

Borrowers can select from a variety of supported assets for investment, and borrow funds from the Protocol. Supported assets can be added and removed via Lendefi’s decentralized governance mechanism \(“DAO”\). The base currency for lending and borrowing is BUSD \(Paxos\), which undergoes regular audits and is subject to regulatory compliance.
