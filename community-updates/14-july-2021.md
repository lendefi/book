In Lendefi’s latest community update, we are pleased to provide our community with the latest information relating to Lendefi’s updated development milestones. In this update we cover information pertaining to our testnet deployment, infrastructure and web interface.

**Testnet Deployment**

Since the last community update on July 4th, the Lendefi protocol on [Binance Smart Chain testnet](https://docs.binance.org/guides/testnet.html) was tweaked to work around the issues caused by [PancakeSwap](https://pancakeswap.finance/)’s \(trade contract\) stack being only partially deployed on the Binance Smart Chain testnet. Additional issues came later, due to the fact that unofficial PancakeSwap is not using the real tokens on testnets, such as USDT, BUSD, DAI, etc, whose prices aren't tracked by ChainLink.

Those issues had been worked around and the web interface can let investors contribute to "Lending Pools" and borrowers perform collaterized trades. Protocol earn fees and lenders receive interest.

The audit recommendations are currently being processed, and the Protocol upgraded accordingly.

**Web Interface**

The web interface is about to be finished and additional testing has identified minor issues, which are being fixed.

**Infrastructure**

The REST API had been modified as well, to work around the issues encountered on the testnet. Additional improvements are coming in the next day or two, in preparation for the mainnet.

**Mainnet Launch**



We thank our community for their continued support and give our assurance that we are fully focussed on these final issues in preparation for mainnet release.
