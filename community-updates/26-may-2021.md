description: Lendefi Community Update

# 26 May 2021

This week our team attended the[ AIBC world summit](https://aibc.world/events/uae/general-info/) in Dubai. We were successful in our goal to network and further our strategic partnerships within the DeFi arena. 

Lendefiâ€™s infrastructure development continues smoothly. The development team has been focused on two separate aspects of the technology stack. They are currently working on the interface design and the development of our Solidity contracts. We are diligently working to meet our delivery milestones and remain on track to achieve them in accordance with our previous update on the [19th of May, 2021](https://lendefi.gitbook.io/lendefi-finance/community-updates/19-may-2021). 

The two noteworthy aspects of our protocol development this week have been:

**User Interface Design** 

Work on integration of the community-voted branding for our web app is progressing well. We are currently building this design into a Figma wireframe. Our aim is to release this as a prototype during the 4th week of this month. 

**Protocol Solidity Contracts**

Our development team has identified a new set of high-quality open-source Solidity contracts which provide powerful scaffolding upon which to build Lendefi specific features. The work over the previous week has been adapted to utilize this new toolset. Although this structure does not necessarily accelerate our time frame for protocol development, it should allow the integration of additional feature sets that were not planned for the initial release. Further details will be provided to the community as work progresses. 

The Lendefi development milestones remain unchanged.
