description: Lendefi Community Update

# 26 May 2021

Lendefi was back in Dubai for the [AIBC world summit](https://aibc.world/events/uae/general-info/) May 25-26th, where we attended to network for further partnerships.  
  
The last week has been quiet on the infrastructure side, which allowed the tech team to focus on two separate aspects of the technology stack: Solidity contracts and interface design.

‌**Protocol Development**

* **User Interface Design** Work continues on the integration of the community-voted branding on the web app into a Figma wireframe design. Still aiming for a 4th week of May prototype. 
* **Protocol** A new opportunity arose and a new set of high-quality open-source Solidity contracts had been found that provide a very powerful scaffolding to build the Lendefi specifics on top of. The work done last week has been adapted to use that new set of tools. While not necessarily accelerating our protocol development timeframe, it should allow potential extra features not planned for the initial release. Details will follow as soon as we know all the new opportunities of those contracts.‌
