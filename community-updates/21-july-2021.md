Lendefi is proud to announce the imminently opening our testnet to the public. We've been working closely with our developers [Blockchain Labs Asia](https://blabs.asia/) \(BLABS\) to expedite this milestone. 

Lendefi’s management expects our public testnet to open within the next week!

Although the Lendefi protocol experienced delays due to our lead developers BLABS, we've been working closely with them to expedite the testnet delivery. Our drive towards launch has been tempred with the view that security is the highest priority for Lendefi’s protocol. 

The Lendefi management team has recently undertaken internal stress testing of the protocol on the Binance Smart Chain testnet. We are confident that Lendefi’s protocol has reached a stage of maturity that enables us to release it for public testing.

The process for volunteer registration will be released to the community within the next week. The engagement of our community in the testnet process will provide valuable input for Lendefi.
